# Hello there

I'm a software engineer dabbling in anything related to CS Education. I specialize in short-form workshops, bringing 6th-12th grade students from no-code to low-code and from low-code to full-code projects.

## Developing Lifemap

Every year I set some form of engineering goals for what I wanted to achive. Sometimes I achieved them. Sometimes it took a little longer to achive. Sometimes, I'm still trying to achieve them.

### 2024 Goals

*This year I've spent as a sort of "gap-year" to figure out what sort of educator / engineer I want to become.*

- [ ] Learn to build in public
  - [ ] Start a *this week I built/learned* blog
- [ ] Complete and launch a side project
- [ ] Build a creative coding project

### 2023 Goals

*College payoff. I had a lot of awesome opportunities in my final year of college.*
